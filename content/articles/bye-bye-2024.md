The year 2024 comes to an end. For me, this year was filled with awesome experiences and countless learnings. In this blog post, I want to look back at what I've reached in 2024. I also want to give a quick overview of what I want to achieve in 2025. So let's get started right away.

## My Commit History

At first, let's take a look at my commit history from the past year.

<img src="/media/blog/bye-bye-2024/commit-history.png" width="1000px" />

As you can see, according to GitHub, I did not code much in the first half of the year. But in fact, GitHub is wrong, because at this time, I didn't know how to use GitHub. However, during this time I have been heavily involved in game development in Unity, but so little of it has stuck that this blog post will ignore this phase.

It wasn't until July that I started to use GitHub due to an internship, which has since become my student job. But wait: You cannot see commits to private repositories in this graph, so where do all the contributions come from?

The majority of the contributions come from my own side project, which was founded in July. It's still at its beginning, but I'm still convinced by it, which is why it will be continued next year.

## My Milestones of the Year

Now I want to take a deeper look at my personal programming milestones of the past year.

### Two-week Internship (July)

At my school, we have internships in grades 9 (practical), 10 (academic) and 11 (social). In 10th grade, I was finally able to do an internship with a software developer, and it was a lot of fun. During the internship, I had the opportunity to work full-time on my own project. And after the internship, I just asked my supervisor if he could imagine hiring me, and he did it.

### Student Job (July - Now)

So I've been working as a software developer in a student job since July. During this time I've learned a lot of new things. Here's a brief summary:

- Basics of PHP (even though I still hate it)
- How to collaborate in a development team
- TypeScript with a focus on Vue

I guess this is the right place to say: **Thank you Benni!**

### Founding of Daytistics (August - Now)

_Daytistics is a personal productivity app that helps users track daily activities, well-being, and diary entries to uncover patterns and improve their lives. It offers both self-hosting options and a paid, hosted service, with features like data visualizations and future AI-based insights._

Many people would call Daytistics a failure. I've been working on it for half a year and there's still not even an MVP. This is because I've noticed time and time again that the chosen tech stack is bad or simply not sustainable for me as a single person. I thought I had found the best tech stack, which consists of Nuxt and Supabase, but that still seems to be not the case, which I'll cover later.

### Me on Twitch (December)

I started streaming on Twitch in mid-December and it's already had a huge impact on me (you'll find out why later). I've started to stream with the goal to improve my english skills and to promote Daytistics. And what should I say, it's fun.

## What comes Next?

Now we've looked enough in the past. Let's focus on the future.

### Live streaming

One of my goals is to stream more often. I want to stream at least once per week because it helps me to improve my English skills. In addition, it's definitely more fun to sit in front of my computer talking to someone instead of talking to myself while doing rubber duck debugging.

### Daytistics goes Mobile

In my second livestream, a viewer told me that he would see Daytistics more in a mobile app than in a web app. This thought has not left me alone. It is hard enough to get a user to constantly track their activities on their phone, let alone sit down at their computer and open a browser and a website. In addition, a mobile app benefits from the algorithms of the app stores.

So I want to spend January evaluating Flutter and Dart for Daytistics. We'll see if it works out. I'll be sure to keep you updated.

I wish you all a great year 2025! I look forward to it.
