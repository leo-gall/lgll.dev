Before you can use images in Flutter, you have to tell Flutter where the images are stored (in the most cases somewhere in the `assets` directory). You can do this by adding items to the `flutter/assets` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
flutter:
  # ...
  assets:
    - assets/img/ # The images are in the assets/img/ folder
  # ...
```

After telling Flutter where your images are, you can use them via the `Image` widget, which is commonly constructed using the `Image.asset` contructor function.

```dart
Image.asset(
    'assets/img/coffee_bean.png',
    width: 25,
    // Changes image color to background color
    color: Colors.brown[100],
    // Multiplies image color with background color to remove
    // the image background (requires that the color of
    // the image is equal to the background color)
    colorBlendMode: BlendMode
        .multiply,
    ),
```
