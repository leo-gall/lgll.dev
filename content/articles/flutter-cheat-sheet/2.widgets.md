Widgets are the core of every Flutter application (like an HTML element). Like in the web, Flutter uses a widget tree to construct complex pages or UI elements. Widgets are represented as classes.

### Stateless Widgets

As the name says, stateless widgets are widgets without state. This means that they cannot store or process data (e.g. data fetching, input values etc...).

A stateless widget can be defined by creating a class which inherits from `StatelessWidget`. It's constructor deconstruct the `key` value from it's parent. The widget itself is returned from the `build` function.

```dart
class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  const Home({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.orange,
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
      margin: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(10, 40, 0, 0),
      child: const Text(
        "Hello World",
        style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 18.0,
            letterSpacing: 4,
            decoration: TextDecoration.underline),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Stateful Widgets

Instead of stateless widgets, stateful widgets consist of two classes: a state class and a widget class. The widget class inherits from `StatefulWidget`, while the state class inherits from a `State<YourWidgetClass>` generic.

The widget class has a `createState` method, which returns a new instance of the state class.

```dart
class CoffeePrefs extends StatefulWidget {
  const CoffeePrefs({super.key});

  @override
  State<CoffeePrefs> createState() => _CoffeePrefsState();
}
```

Like a stateless widget, the state class (which start by convention with an underscore) has a `build` method. Its state is represented by properties on the class. If you want to update the state, you have to do this by calling the setState function which wraps the block where you can update the state.

```dart
class _CoffeePrefsState extends State<CoffeePrefs> {
  int strength = 1;

  void increaseStrength() {
    setState(() {
      strength = strength < 5 ? strength + 1 : 1;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(children: [
      Row(children: [
        Text("$strength"),
      ]),
    ]);
  }
}
```

::alert
You can access the widget class from the state class by using the `widget` property of the parent `State<YourWidgetClass>`.
