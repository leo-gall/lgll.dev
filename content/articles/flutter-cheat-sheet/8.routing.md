Routing in mobile applications is all about pushing and popping routes from the history stack. The `Navigator` class manages a stack of routes (screens) in Flutter. It provides methods to navigate between screens:

```dart
// Push a new screen
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
);

// Pop current screen
Navigator.pop(context);

// Replace current screen
Navigator.pushReplacement(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NewScreen()),
);
```
