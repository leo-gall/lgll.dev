### Setup

Before you can start start using Riverpod, you have to do two steps. First, you have to install the `flutter_riverpod` package:

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_riverpod
```

After installing Riverpod, you have to wrap your application with a `ProviderScope` widget.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(const ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}
```

### Providers

#### Read-only Providers

Read-only providers are the simplest form of providers in Riverpod. They provide immutable data to the application.

```dart

const List<String> allProducts = <String>[
  "apples",
  "bananas"
];

final productsProvider = Provider((ref) => allProducts);

final reducedProductsProvider = Provider((ref) {
  // watches changes to a provider state and executes actions when changes occur
  final products = ref.watch(productsProvider);
  return products.where((product) => product.length < 50).toList();
});
```

#### Notifier Providers

Notifier providers are used to create and manage state that can change over time. They are more powerful than read-only providers because they allow you to define custom logic for updating the state.

To create a notifier provider, you need to extend the `Notifier` class and override the `build` method to define the initial state. You can then define methods to update the state.

**Example using a Notifier Provider**

```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class CounterNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() {
    return 0; // initial state
  }

  void increment() {
    state++; // update state
  }

  void decrement() {
    state--; // update state
  }
}

final counterProvider = NotifierProvider<CounterNotifier, int>((ref) {
  return CounterNotifier();
});
```

In this example, we create a `CounterNotifier` class that extends `Notifier<int>`. The `build` method sets the initial state to `0`. We also define two methods, `increment` and `decrement`, to update the state.

To use the `counterProvider` in your widget, you can use a `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget` to watch or read the provider's state.

```dart
class CounterWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final counter = ref.watch(counterProvider);

    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Counter: $counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).increment(),
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).decrement(),
          child: Text('Decrement'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

#### Generated Providers

Generated providers aren't a new provider type. Instead, they are used to generate other provider types using annotations. Before you can use them, you have to add two dependencies to your project:

```sh
flutter pub add riverpod_annotations
flutter pub add dev:riverpod_generator
flutter pub add dev:build_runner
```

Generating providers is not too useful when you just want to use a simple read-only provider like shown above. But if you want to use more complex providers it can be really useful.

**Example using a read-only Provider**

Okay, let's start with a simple example, by rewriting the providers from above as generated providers:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

// IMPORTANT
part 'products_provider.g.dart';

const List<String> allProducts = <String>[
  "apples",
  "bananas"
];

@riverpod
List<String> products(ref) {
  return allProducts;
}

@riverpod
List<String> reducedProducts(Ref ref) {
  return allProducts.where((product) => product.length < 50).toList();
}
```

After writing your code you have to execute the following command:

```sh
dart run build_runner watch
```

This command will watch for any changes and generate the necessary code for your annotated providers into the file `<your-file-name>.g.dart`. Because this file is a part of your file, you can import the providers directly from your file, instead of using the file with the `g.dart` suffix. You can access the providers using the variables `reducedProductsProvider` and `productsProvider`.

**Example using Notifiers**
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

// IMPORTANT
part 'counter_provider.g.dart';

@riverpod
class Counter extends _$Counter {
  @override
  int build() {
    return 0; // initial state
  }

  void increment() {
    state++; // update state
  }

  void decrement() {
    state--; // update state
  }
}
```

After writing your code, execute the following command to generate the necessary code:

```sh
dart run build_runner watch
```

This will generate the code into the file `counter_provider.g.dart`. You can access the provider using the variable `counterProvider`.

To use the `counterProvider` in your widget, you can use a `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget` to watch or read the provider's state.

```dart
class CounterWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final counter = ref.watch(counterProvider);

    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Counter: $counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).increment(),
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).decrement(),
          child: Text('Decrement'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### Consumers

#### Stateless Consumers

Stateless consumers are used to consume state in stateless widgets. Before you can consume state in a stateless widget, you have to 
change two parts of the widget.

1. Your widget should no longer inherit from `StatelessWidget`. Instead it should inherit from `ConsumerWidget`.
2. The `build` method of your widget, now takes another argument: A `WidgetRef`

Now, you have two ways to consume the state:

```dart
// watches the provider and rebuilds the widget when the state changes
final allProducts = ref.watch(productsProvider);

// reads the provider once and does not rebuild the widget
final allProducts = ref.read(productsProvider);
```

#### Stateful Consumers

Stateful consumers are used to consume state in stateful widgets. Before you can consume state in a stateful widget, you have to change two parts of the widget.

1. Your widget should no longer inherit from `StatefulWidget`. Instead, it should inherit from `ConsumerStatefulWidget`.
2. The state class of your widget should no longer inherit from `State<StatefulWidget>`. Instead, it should inherit from `ConsumerState`.

However, you don't have to add an extra argument to the `build` function, because you can access the `WidgetRef` via the `ref` property.
You can consume the state in the same way as for stateless consumers.
