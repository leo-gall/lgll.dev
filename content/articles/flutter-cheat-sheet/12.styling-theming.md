This section covers how to make a consistently designed user interface throughout your application, by introducing you to the `ThemeData` and `TextTheme` object

### Customizing the Base Styling

To customize the base styling we have to customize the theme of the material app, which can be done by passing a `ThemeData` object into the constructor of the `MaterialApp`.

```dart
// lib/theme.dart

ThemeData primaryTheme = ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: AppColors.primaryColor,
  ),

  textTheme: TextTheme(
    bodyMedium:
        TextStyle(color: AppColors.textColor, fontSize: 16, letterSpacing: 1),
  ),
);
```

```dart
// lib/main.dart

import 'package:my_project/theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: Home(), theme: primaryTheme));
}
```

There are much more widgets which can be customized using the `ThemeData` object. You can read more about in the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes).

### Applying Styles

Some styles have to be applied to a widget to work, because there are multiple kinds of this widget. A good example for this is the `TextWidget`.

```dart
Text(
  'Character List',
  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleMedium
  // -> Applies the stylings for title medium
)
```

### Google Fonts

Flutter makes it as easy as possible to use Google Fonts. Google Fonts offers a pub package called `google_fonts` which makes integrating custom fonts straight-forward.

It can be installed using the following command:

```sh
dart pub add google_fonts
```

After the installation, you can use the package like this:

```dart
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';

Text(
  text,
  style: GoogleFonts.kanit(
    // Here goes your custom styling
    textStyle: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium,
  ),
);
```

### Icons

Icons in Flutter can be accessed through the `Icons` class, which provides Material Design icons. To use an icon, simply reference it in an `Icon` widget:

```dart
Icon(
  Icons.coffee,
  color: Colors.brown,
  size: 24.0,
)
```

You can also use icons in buttons with `IconButton`:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.add),
  onPressed: () {},
)
```

### Styling Complex Widgets with Containers

Some widgets cannot be fully styled, without issues. For example, if you want to apply a gradient to any kind of button, you will notice, that buttons do not have a `decoration` argument. So, what do we do?

The answer is to put a text button inside a container, because the container can be styled without any issues.

```dart
class StyledButton extends StatelessWidget {
  const StyledButton({
    super.key,
    required this.onPressed,
    required this.child,
  });

  final VoidCallback onPressed;
  final Widget child;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TextButton(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Container(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10, horizontal: 20),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [
              AppColors.primaryColor,
              AppColors.primaryAccent,
            ],
            begin: Alignment.topCenter,
            end: Alignment.bottomCenter,
          ),
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
        ),
        child: child,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
