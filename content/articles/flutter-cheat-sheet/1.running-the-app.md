After installing Flutter on your system (which can be quiet complicated) and creating a new Flutter app, you can run your application using `flutter run`.

Your app will start executing in the main function of the `lib/main.dart` file. The main function must call `runApp` to start the app. The `runApp` function takes a widget as an argument (in most cases `MaterialApp`).

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: const Text('My Coffee Id'),
      backgroundColor: Colors.brown[700],
      centerTitle: true,
    ),
    body: const Home(),
  )));
}
```
