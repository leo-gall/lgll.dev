Lifecycle hooks in Flutter are methods that get called at different stages of a widget's life. They are essential for managing resources, initializing data, and cleaning up when a widget is removed from the widget tree. Here are some common lifecycle hooks and their use cases:

- **initState**: Called when the widget is inserted into the widget tree. This is where you should initialize any state or data that the widget needs.

  ```dart
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize data or state here
  }
  ```

- **didChangeDependencies**: Called when the widget's dependencies change. This can happen, for example, if an inherited widget that the current widget depends on changes.

  ```dart
  @override
  void didChangeDependencies() {
    super.didChangeDependencies();
    // Handle changes in dependencies here
  }
  ```

- **build**: Called whenever the widget needs to be rendered. This method should return the widget tree that represents the UI.

  ```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lifecycle Hooks Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
  ```

- **didUpdateWidget**: Called whenever the widget configuration changes. This is useful for handling updates when the parent widget rebuilds and passes new data to the current widget.

  ```dart
  @override
  void didUpdateWidget(covariant OldWidget oldWidget) {
    super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
    // Handle updates here
  }
  ```

- **dispose**: Called when the widget is removed from the widget tree. This is where you should clean up any resources, such as controllers or streams, to prevent memory leaks.
  ```dart
  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up resources here
    super.dispose();
  }
  ```
